// Primary Keys

Each row in every table has one primary key
No other row in the same table can have the same value
99% of the time called 'id'
Either an integer or a UUID
Will never change

// Foreign Keys

Rows only have this if they belong to another record
Many rows in the same table can have the same foreign key
Name varies, usually called something like 'xyz_id'
Exactly equal to the primary key of the referenced row
Will change if the relationship changes

// Notes on Joins and Aggregation

//Joins
Produces values by merging together rows from different related tables
Use a join most times that you're asked to find data that involves multiple resources

// Aggregation
Looks at many rows and calculates a single value
Words like 'most', 'average', 'least' are a sign that you need to use an aggregation. 

// Notes on Joins

Table order between 'FROM' and 'JOIN' frequently makes a difference
We must give context if column names collide
Tables can be renamed using the 'AS' keyword
There are a few kind of joins

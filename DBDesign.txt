google sql schema as needed

// Primary Keys

Each row in every table has one primary key
No other row in the same table can have the same value
99% of the time called 'id'
Either an integer or a UUID
Will never change

// Foreign Keys

Rows only have this if they belong to another record
Many rows in the same table can have the same foreign key
Name varies, usually called something like 'xyz_id'
Exactly equal to the primary key of the referenced row
Will change if the relationship changes
